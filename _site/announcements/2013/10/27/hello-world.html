<p>My first blog used Wordpress as the platform. Wordpress was great, it had tons of features and a lot of themes. It was pretty easy to get started, and I wrote quite a few essays about religion. I eventually abandoned that blog. My second blog, a reboot of the first, was also on Wordpress. I wrote a few more essays about politics, and I eventually abandoned that one too. </p>

<p>My next blog was on Tumblr. Tumblr also has tons of features and a lot of themes. It was easier than Wordpress to get started and I&#39;ve posted tons of gifs that I&#39;ve found on other Tumblr blogs. I haven&#39;t abandoned Tumblr (yet), but I&#39;ve also never posted original content to Tumblr. </p>

<p>My next blog was on <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogram</a>. Scriptogram is a dead-simple platform that has way less features and only a handful of themes when compared to Wordpress or Tumblr. I wrote a couple posts and abandoned that one as well.</p>

<p>My next attempt was on Medium. You can already guess how that ended up.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve found is that I&#39;m becoming increasingly allergic to the idea of using someone else&#39;s platform. Marco Arment wrote an interesting <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/08/05/be-your-own-platform">piece</a> about why you should be your own platform and I think it hits the nail on the head.</p>

<p>With Wordpress, while the guts of the software are open, it&#39;s incredibly time consuming to modify Wordpress. You end up having to learn Wordpress just to create a plugin or design a theme. Learning Wordpress has its benefits, but it means that you are learning a skill that is non-translatable. If Wordpress is discontinued, all of that knowledge you&#39;ve learned about Wordpress is useless. </p>

<p>Tumblr isn&#39;t open source like Wordpress, but it is far more powerful and a lot easier to get started. Building a theme for Tumblr also requires learning a lot about how Tumblr works. Another non-translatable skill. </p>

<p>Scriptogram isn&#39;t open source nor nearly as powerful as Tumblr/Wordpress and relies on your Dropbox account for file storage. It&#39;s definitely a neat idea, but it leaves your blog vulnerable to whenever Dropbox changes their API or Scriptogram is bought or shutdown.</p>

<p>I am perhaps overly cynical when it comes to judging how long a company will last. That cynicism has led me to Jekyll.</p>

<p>Jekyll is open source, it&#39;s written in Ruby, uses Markdown for text formatting, and generates a static HTML/CSS website that you can easily export. There&#39;s very little to learn about how Jekyll works, since I already know Ruby, HTML and CSS. The documentation could use some work, but it&#39;s straight forward enough.</p>

<p>Hopefully I don&#39;t abandon this one. </p>
