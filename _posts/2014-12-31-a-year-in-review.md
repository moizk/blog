Last year, I put together a post that outlined my goals for 2014. It was really helpful as it forced me to collect my thoughts, make specific goals and I read the post often throughout the year to see how I was doing. This time, I’ll start with some retrospectives about each of my projects.

## Campusvine

At the start of 2014, my primary goal was to increase revenue from Campusvine, the product I’ve worked on ever since I was 19 (that’s 5 years). At the end of the year, it’s obvious that Campusvine will run as long as the current clients pay for it, but it’s unlikely there will be any renewed effort in finding new clients or major new feature development. 

This post is an early eulogy for Campusvine. The kind that is written before someone has died, but when their death seems all but certain in the near future. There is always hope for a Rasputin-like miracle, but it’s very unlikely.

In September 2008, I was a first-year student at Stony Brook University. I remember seeing the then-President of the student government walking around campus in a suit and I was truly impressed. When you see another student wear a suit, you automatically assume the person is in someway important and grant them a lot of credibility. 

I assumed the student government was comprised of intelligent and hard working students, the best of their fellow students. Then I had to negotiate funding for my club and all of those illusions were shattered.

In September 2009, I became a Senator in the student government at Stony Brook University with my primary focus being to restructure how the student government deals with onboarding new clubs and offering them funding. I spent the summer reading every document the student government published in its recent history. I later found out that I was the only Senator who did that.

After absorbing as much information possible, it was clear that the student government had much bigger problems than how it interacted with new clubs. I spent the next three months digging into the financial procedures of the student government. It was clear that was where the only legitimacy of the organization resided. 

In December 2009, I led an effort to impeach the current Treasurer (he was truly terrible at his job) and was then appointed the Treasurer to replace him. During the impeachment is when I became friends with [Alex](link). We shared an interest in nerdy things, and we both had to deal with the student government for getting funding for our clubs.

Alex spent the Winter Break prototyping ALLOCATE, a digital voucher system to improve the operations of the Treasurer’s role. I learned a lot about how to rollout software in an organization and it was a great experience. 

Fast forward to November 2011, and Alex asked me if I’d like to become a co-founder in Heuretix Software, Inc. The company established to continue development on ALLOCATE after we left Stony Brook. With no hesitation, I said yes. We spent the next few months rewriting the product from scratch. We gave it the name Campusvine.

One day, when we were walking out of Starbucks in the Student Union, Alex said to me, “you’re going to have to learn how to code if you’re going to gain the respect of future technical employees.” That really bothered me. I had just spent the last few years proving to everyone (or at least myself) that I could accomplish an array of different jobs better than anyone before me. How was learning to code a necessary hurdle? 

The reason it annoyed me so much was that it struck one of my deepest insecurities. I’ve been working on websites in some form ever since I was 10 years old (the year we got a computer in my home). But, my websites were effectively images designed in Photoshop, and I used Dreamweaver to code everything up. I tried to fiddle with PHP, but it never took. I took an Introduction to Programming (Visual Basic) class in High School and I was easily the best in the class. But, deep down, I didn’t think I was smart enough to do software or major in Computer Science. 

I honestly don’t know why I had this lack of confidence in myself. This is a mistake I’ll never repeat. Nothing created by other humans is beyond my ability to understand. It simply requires focus and consistent effort.

But, even though it annoyed me, I never disliked Alex for pushing me to learn how to code. I am reminded of a quote by Socrates:

> “I am that gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long…arousing and persuading and reproaching…You will not easily find another like me.”

It’s important to keep friends who act as gadflies close. They keep you sharp and remind you of your faults. 

Fast forward to the Summer of 2012, I moved to Brooklyn with a couple other friends to work on Campusvine. It was during the summer when Alex’s words became true. I was unable to galvanize the team to pursue my ideas for where to take Campusvine. It was primarily because I didn’t understand nor appreciate the technical hurdles required to achieve my vision. 

It’s at that moment that I began learning as much as possible about Ruby/Rails and learned to code so I could begin implementing my vision. 

By November 2012, I had learned enough about Rails to begin contributing, but by that time we didn’t have enough money pay our employees employees. Alex began looking for a full time job. That left me in a situation as the only one who worked on Campusvine as my primary focus. But I also had to find work to pay my bills and rent.

Looking back, I realize that is when Campusvine had a stroke. It’s been on life support ever since. 

Above everything, the biggest challenge with Campusvine was not in the software, it was in selling the product. We sold Stony Brook as students, and our second client was through a connection we had at Stony Brook. I waffled back and forth on business models, should we be direct to consumers? Should we focus on sales with multiple year contracts? Sales was a discouragingly long process and the consumer route required a major reworking of Campusvine to accomplish. I was never convinced either would really work on its own, so I hedged my bets and focused on both. 

As Steve Jobs said, focus is saying no. I didn’t say no enough. 

Overall, I look at Campusvine as a personal success, but not a successful business. It is effectively a software consultancy at this point that has an annual revenue of roughly 30k. It only has around 1k in annual expenses. 

### 2014 Goals Scorecard

Here is what I listed as my goals for 2014.

1. Events can be created without being tied to our financial component.
2. Remove our dependency on Twitter Bootstrap and write our own CSS Framework.
3. Use EmberJS for as much of the web application as possible.
4. Start the 2014 Academic Year with more than two schools.
5. Release a Campusvine iPhone application.

I accomplished 1/5. 

Events are no longer tied to the financial aspect of Campusvine. 

I’ve removed large components of Bootstrap, and you wouldn’t know that we’re using Bootstrap unless you looked at the class names. I decided that the shared knowledge of Bootstrap was better than attempting to write the an entire CSS framework. 

We began working on an EmberJS rewrite of Campusvine but it never saw the light of day. It was too ambitious of a project, and it was poorly scoped. 

We’re still working with two schools, though we have increased revenue from those schools from $19,000 to $28,000.

And I never began working on a Campusvine iPhone app.
