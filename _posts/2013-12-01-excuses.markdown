There is always an excuse.

Today my excuse was that the “L” key stopped working on my Macbook Air. Within an hour, the right Option key was transformed into an L key. How you may ask? That question was far too contrived.

I’ll tell you how anyway though.

I found a [keyboard remapping application](https://pqrs.org/index.html.en) that featured a comprehensive but poorly organized library of documentation. Doesn’t seem like the guy is a native English speaker.  After rummaging through the documentation, I put this code into the program:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
    <item>
      <name>Swap Option with l</name>
      <identifier>private.swap_option_and_tab</identifier>
      <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::RawValue::0x25</autogen>
    </item>
</root>
{% endhighlight %}

Magically (not really, there’s an obvious method), my right option key, now functions as if it is an L key. It’s strange. My hands still believe that my L key still works. It’s like a phantom limb, but way worse. 

Apparently the “L” key is [referred](https://github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook/blob/version_9.2.0/src/bridge/generator/keycode/data/KeyCode.data) to as 0x25 by OSX. I’m not entirely sure why. 

There is always an excuse. There is always an excuse not to code, to design, to write, to think. My L key is was probably the best excuse I’ve had in months not to write.

Fuck excuses. It’s my time to assert my opinions onto the world.

Fuck fear. It’s time to be aware of inevitable failure and try anyway.
