Brendan Eich has resigned as CEO of Mozilla and the world is a slightly better place as a result. For those who are unaware of the situation, Eich donated $1,000 to support Proposition 8 in California. Proposition 8 attempted to add "only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California" into the California constitution.

I've spent a bit of time <strike>procrastinating</strike> reading through the <strike>cesspool of the internet</strike> comments on Twitter/Hacker News responding to Mr. Eich's resignation.

The responses can be boiled down to effectively two camps:

* I disagree with Eich's views on gay marriage, and agree with those calling for his resignation.
* I disagree with Eich's views on gay marriage, but disagree with those calling for his resignation.

I'm firmly in the first camp, and want to explore why I disagree with the second camp.

The second camp typically asserts the following arguments:

* Eich's opinions do not effect his competency as CEO.
* Eich's opinions are protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.

I think both arguments are irrelevant.

The first argument is also untrue, as half of the board of Mozilla resigned and many publicly employees called for Eich's resignation on Twitter.

No one has questioned Eich's ability to hold an opinion. What people are questioning is whether or not it is responsible for a company to appoint him as the public leader of a company since he holds opinions that are, in essence, bigoted.

### What qualifies Eich's opinions as bigotry?

There are multiple approaches to disagreeing with gay marriage:

* I disagree with gay marriage, but I recognize their right to marry.
* I disagree with gay marriage, and I do not recognize their right to marry.

Eich is within the second camp.

But, Mr. Eich's opinions do not end there.

Eich believes that the State of California should not allow gay marriage.

The addition of the last statement is why his views are incompatible with modernity. Eich is not satisfied with not entering into a gay marriage himself, which is a non-harmful way of disagreeing with gay marriage. 

I've noticed many responses to Eich's resignation equate Eich's intolerance of gay marriage with those who disagree with Eich's opinions (and are asking for his resignation). This is a invalid attempt to argue that both sides are equally wrong.

It is one thing to disagree with gay marriage, and it is another to actively attempt to ban gay marriage. 

Eich would rather that no one be able to enter into a gay marriage as the result of his belief. It is that approach that must be repudiated and rejected by society.
