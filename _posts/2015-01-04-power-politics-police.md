Mayor Bill de Blasio's approach to the recent protests against the New York City Police Department (NYPD) highlights his misunderstanding of power. By undermining the police, de Blasio undermines his own power. The efficacy and power of the NYPD is not merely correlated to the financial importance of New York City, it is its foundation. A city derives its power from the police (and national governments from their military). 

As a candidate for Mayor, de Blasio was a vocal critic of the Stop, Question, and Frisk program. To most Democrats in the city, the program was little more than institutionalized racial profiling. Candidate de Blasio offered himself as [uniquely positioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirlane_McCray) to replace the program and thereby begin to heal race relations in the City. 

The procedures of the program were, to a large degree, irrelevant. The public was against racial profiling and Stop, Question, and Frisk was an easy target. Candidate de Blasio argued that the program undermined the relationship between the police and the community. Additionally he asserted that Stop and Frisk disproportionately effected young men of color.  





Mayor de Blasio may disagree with the role of the police in establishing and maintaining a civil society, he cannot however supplant it. 





His error is the difference between politics and power, or rather, campaigning and governing.

You campaign with ideas, but you govern with facts.

The transition from one who can campaign to one who can govern is not easy but it is essential. That transition involves associating with power, not rejecting it.
