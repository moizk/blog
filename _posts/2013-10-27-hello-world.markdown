My first blog used Wordpress as the platform. Wordpress was great, it had tons of features and a lot of themes. It was pretty easy to get started, and I wrote quite a few essays about religion. I eventually abandoned that blog. My second blog, a reboot of the first, was also on Wordpress. I wrote a few more essays about politics, and I eventually abandoned that one too. 

My next blog was on Tumblr. Tumblr also has tons of features and a lot of themes. It was easier than Wordpress to get started and I've posted tons of gifs that I've found on other Tumblr blogs. I haven't abandoned Tumblr (yet), but I've also never posted original content to Tumblr. 

My next blog was on [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am/). Scriptogram is a dead-simple platform that has way less features and only a handful of themes when compared to Wordpress or Tumblr. I wrote a couple posts and abandoned that one as well.

My next attempt was on Medium. You can already guess how that ended up.

What I've found is that I'm becoming increasingly allergic to the idea of using someone else's platform. Marco Arment wrote an interesting [piece](http://www.marco.org/2013/08/05/be-your-own-platform) about why you should be your own platform and I think it hits the nail on the head.

With Wordpress, while the guts of the software are open, it's incredibly time consuming to modify Wordpress. You end up having to learn Wordpress just to create a plugin or design a theme. Learning Wordpress has its benefits, but it means that you are learning a skill that is non-translatable. If Wordpress is discontinued, all of that knowledge you've learned about Wordpress is useless. 

Tumblr isn't open source like Wordpress, but it is far more powerful and a lot easier to get started. Building a theme for Tumblr also requires learning a lot about how Tumblr works. Another non-translatable skill. 

Scriptogram isn't open source nor nearly as powerful as Tumblr/Wordpress and relies on your Dropbox account for file storage. It's definitely a neat idea, but it leaves your blog vulnerable to whenever Dropbox changes their API or Scriptogram is bought or shutdown.

I am perhaps overly cynical when it comes to judging how long a company will last. That cynicism has led me to Jekyll.

Jekyll is open source, it's written in Ruby, uses Markdown for text formatting, and generates a static HTML/CSS website that you can easily export. There's very little to learn about how Jekyll works, since I already know Ruby, HTML and CSS. The documentation could use some work, but it's straight forward enough.

Hopefully I don't abandon this one.
