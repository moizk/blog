<p>Marxism was the first political ideology that seemed compelling to my teenage self. Marxism provides a framework based on a binary division of society, those who have, and those who have not.</p>

<p>According to Marx, all of history can be summarized as the building of tension between the two groups, and the clashes between the groups, often marked the end of an age, or epoch.</p>

<p>This binary view of history is a useful lens that brings history into focus. If you identify as being the other, that is to say, the have-not, this view provides the framework for all other political beliefs and values to be based upon.</p>

<p>It was easy for me to identify as a have-not. Growing up as an immigrant in America, I never fit in to American culture nor did I identify with my ethnic identity (Indian). I did not have an identity. I never felt as if I belonged with a group, nor of a geographical place. The truth is, those feelings have never left.</p>

<p>Marxism presented itself as a panacea. It temporarily solved the identity problem. I identified as being against Capitalism, materialism, and whatever else shapes an American identity.</p>

<p>The unraveling of my Marxist identity began when I attempted to achieve intellectual consistency. At some point, you realize the  pursuit is futile. It&#39;s impossible. That realization leads to the end of many friendships.</p>

<h3>A Coming of Age</h3>

<p>During college, I had an opportunity to redefine my identity. I was in the student government, and I agreed with the administration more than the students on matters of tuition and fees. I began to identify as an administrator more than a student. That is to say, as the one with the power in the relationship.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I realized that identities are entirely arbitrary. I could simply assert to everyone that I was someone worth trusting with half a million dollars and shockingly, they would.</p>

<p>I never fully understood why people were (and still are) so willing to trust me, even I didn&#39;t trust myself that much. But if people were willing to give up their power, I was willing to take it.</p>

<h3>&quot;Your luxury is my displacement&quot;</h3>

<p>These slogans are what provoked me to write this essay. I am currently living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, the poster child of &quot;hipster&quot; gentrification, and these slogans are stenciled into the sidewalk around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Their strategy is simple, induce guilt because that is all that is left to achieve. Arguments such as these assume and accept defeat while seeking to attain the moral high-ground. The moral victory is satisfying until the despair of the material defeat sets in. Then it is displacement.</p>

<h3>&quot;Gentrification is the new colonialism&quot;</h3>

<p>Karl Marx on British colonialism in India for the New York Daily Tribune:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;we must not forget that these idyllic village-communities, inoffensive though they may appear, â€¦ , <strong>that they restrained the human mind within the smallest possible compass</strong>, making it the unresisting tool of superstition, enslaving it beneath traditional rules, depriving it of all grandeur and historical energies.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marx does not hold the British blameless, but he does recognize the presence of one hand clapping. To understand colonialism (and especially post-colonial societies) therefore is to reject the existence of a moral high-ground.</p>

<p>Power always wins. It centralizes and then expands. Power is never granted, it is taken by those who assert it. That is the history of New York City, and that is it&#39;s future.</p>
