<p>In 2013, I learned how to program. I also spent a large part of the year refining and improving my design ability. I&#39;m pretty happy with my progress so far and there is a lot of room for improvement. </p>

<p>This is a good time to review my accomplishments and failures for 2013 and outline some goals for 2014. I&#39;ll start with Campusvine. </p>

<h4>Campusvine</h4>

<h5>A Year In Review</h5>

<p>Campusvine is my main project. It&#39;s a collection of tools that help students plan, budget, and promote events on a college campus. The summer months (when school is not in session) was dead, Spring was the peak of activity and Fall 2013 was way better than Fall 2012. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what we accomplished in 2013 with Campusvine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launched the event promotion part of Campusvine.</li>
<li>Start the year with two schools using our software.</li>
<li>Redesigned the financial component and made it responsive.</li>
<li>Rewrote the system that moves check requests between people.</li>
<li>Registered a trademark for the name Campusvine.</li>
<li>Printed a couple hundred Campusvine t-shirts.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Campusvine: Future Plans</h5>

<p>Here is what I hope we can accomplish in 2014 with Campusvine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Events can be created without being tied to our financial component.</li>
<li>Remove our dependency on Twitter Bootstrap and write our own CSS Framework.</li>
<li>Use EmberJS for as much of the web application as possible.</li>
<li>Start the 2014 Academic Year with more than two schools.</li>
<li>Release a Campusvine iPhone application.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope we can pull it off.</p>

<h4>Nooklyn</h4>

<h5>A Year In Review</h5>

<p><img src="http://moiz-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/img/nooklyn_stats.png" alt="Nooklyn Stats">
<p class="img-explanation">Nooklyn visitors from Jan 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013</p></p>

<p>Nooklyn was my first project that I was able to control the technical and design direction. I learned a lot from working on Nooklyn, as it was my first project after learning how to program in Ruby and work with Rails.  The first half of 2013 was spent building out the structure of the application and the second half of the year was spent on refining the presentation of the website.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my Nooklyn accomplishments for 2013: </p>

<ul>
<li>Create a project that people use daily to teach myself how to program</li>
<li>Control the technical direction of a web app.</li>
<li>Get paid to build a website.</li>
<li>100k+ visits, 1000+ registered users, and 2500+ likes.</li>
<li>Began learning JavaScript/jQuery.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Nooklyn: Future Plans</h5>

<p>Here&#39;s what I plan to accomplish with Nooklyn in 2014:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable people to explore places in a neighborhood (specifically Bushwick).</li>
<li>Build roommate finding functionality.</li>
<li>500k+ visits, 5k registered users, 10k+ likes.</li>
<li>Release a simple Nooklyn iPhone App.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I  can do it. </p>

<h4>Personal Goals</h4>

<p>Outside of those two projects, I have a few more goals for this year: </p>

<ul>
<li>Create and release a CSS Framework</li>
<li>Write and publish something every two weeks</li>
<li>Design, program and ship an iOS app</li>
<li>Become good at JavaScript/jQuery</li>
<li>Learn EmberJS and attend Ember Camp in Portland</li>
<li>Post a design on Dribbble every month</li>
<li>Create my first icon set</li>
<li>Travel to San Francisco during the Spring/Summer time. </li>
</ul>

<p>Above everything, my desire is to work for myself. I want to only work on something because its interesting to me. I want to avoid attempting to solve problems that other people find interesting. I have enough of my own. </p>
