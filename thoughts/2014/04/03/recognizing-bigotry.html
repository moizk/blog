<div class="post">
<p>Brendan Eich has resigned as CEO of Mozilla and the world is a slightly better place as a result. For those who are unaware of the situation, Eich donated $1,000 to support Proposition 8 in California. Proposition 8 attempted to add &quot;only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California&quot; into the California constitution.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a bit of time <strike>procrastinating</strike> reading through the <strike>cesspool of the internet</strike> comments on Twitter/Hacker News responding to Mr. Eich&#39;s resignation.</p>

<p>The responses can be boiled down to effectively two camps:</p>

<ul>
<li>I disagree with Eich&#39;s views on gay marriage, and agree with those calling for his resignation.</li>
<li>I disagree with Eich&#39;s views on gay marriage, but disagree with those calling for his resignation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m firmly in the first camp, and want to explore why I disagree with the second camp.</p>

<p>The second camp typically asserts the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eich&#39;s opinions do not effect his competency as CEO.</li>
<li>Eich&#39;s opinions are protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think both arguments are irrelevant.</p>

<p>The first argument is also untrue, as half of the board of Mozilla resigned and many publicly employees called for Eich&#39;s resignation on Twitter.</p>

<p>No one has questioned Eich&#39;s ability to hold an opinion. What people are questioning is whether or not it is responsible for a company to appoint him as the public leader of a company since he holds opinions that are, in essence, bigoted.</p>

<h3>What qualifies Eich&#39;s opinions as bigotry?</h3>

<p>There are multiple approaches to disagreeing with gay marriage:</p>

<ul>
<li>I disagree with gay marriage, but I recognize their right to marry.</li>
<li>I disagree with gay marriage, and I do not recognize their right to marry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eich is within the second camp.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Eich&#39;s opinions do not end there.</p>

<p>Eich believes that the State of California should not allow gay marriage.</p>

<p>The addition of the last statement is why his views are incompatible with modernity. Eich is not satisfied with not entering into a gay marriage himself, which is a non-harmful way of disagreeing with gay marriage. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed many responses to Eich&#39;s resignation equate Eich&#39;s intolerance of gay marriage with those who disagree with Eich&#39;s opinions (and are asking for his resignation). This is a invalid attempt to argue that both sides are equally wrong.</p>

<p>It is one thing to disagree with gay marriage, and it is another to actively attempt to ban gay marriage. </p>

<p>Eich would rather that no one be able to enter into a gay marriage as the result of his belief. It is that approach that must be repudiated and rejected by society. </p>
