<p>I was reading Ben Thompson’s excellent <a href="https://stratechery.com/membership/">Daily Update</a> earlier today and he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Ive, as this profile argues, now serves Jobs’ function as the soul of Apple, my characterization is surely obsolete: perhaps we need to think of Apple as a design company with a specialty in computers, not the other way around. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was struck by two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The idea of a company having a soul embodied by an individual.</li>
<li>That Apple is now a design company, with a specialty in computers. </li>
</ol>

<h3>The Soul of a Company</h3>

<p>The first point is striking because typically the identity of a company is heavily tied to its CEO. The idea that Apple is challenging the traditional notions of how a company ought to operate is not surprising. </p>

<p>At the top of Apple, you have a flat structure of executives who are all incredibly powerful in their area. Each of the SVPs could leave and be a CEO at a another company. At Apple, the CEO has certain specific responsibilities that other executive don’t have. This model works well because Ive is seemingly uninterested in most aspects of the CEOs job. </p>

<p>There is an important distinction to be made between positive and negative power. Positive power is the ability to shape how the options for a decision are formulated. Negative power is the ability to reject a decision arbitrarily. The use of negative power is fundamentally because the systems built up around the positive power have failed. </p>

<p>This is where collaboration within a company becomes important. Thoughtful and intelligent people are mostly uninterested in simply making decisions from the list of options they are given. They are instead interested in understanding the process behind where the options came from. </p>

<h3>Design vs. Computer Company</h3>

<p>This observation struck me because this is fundamentally what I’m trying to do with Nooklyn. When I started working with Nooklyn in November 2012, it was firmly a brokerage with a focus on its software. I’d like to flip it - Nooklyn should be a software company with a focus on real estate. </p>

<p>It may seem like a subtle shift, but as I’ve read about a company’s values - the order matters. Apple’s values are product and profit, but it’s important that product comes before profit. The same is true for Nooklyn. The first value is software, the second is real estate. This flip in values will enable Nooklyn to destroy our competition. </p>
