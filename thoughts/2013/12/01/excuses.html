<div class="post">
<p>There is always an excuse.</p>

<p>Today my excuse was that the “L” key stopped working on my Macbook Air. Within an hour, the right Option key was transformed into an L key. How you may ask? That question was far too contrived.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you how anyway though.</p>

<p>I found a <a href="https://pqrs.org/index.html.en">keyboard remapping application</a> that featured a comprehensive but poorly organized library of documentation. Doesn’t seem like the guy is a native English speaker.  After rummaging through the documentation, I put this code into the program:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Swap Option with l&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;identifier&gt;private.swap_option_and_tab&lt;/identifier&gt;
      &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::RawValue::0x25&lt;/autogen&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Magically (not really, there’s an obvious method), my right option key, now functions as if it is an L key. It’s strange. My hands still believe that my L key still works. It’s like a phantom limb, but way worse.</p>

<p>Apparently the “L” key is <a href="https://github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook/blob/version_9.2.0/src/bridge/generator/keycode/data/KeyCode.data">referred</a> to as 0x25 by OSX. I’m not entirely sure why.</p>

<p>There is always an excuse. There is always an excuse not to code, to design, to write, to think. My L key is was probably the best excuse I’ve had in months not to write.</p>

<p>Fuck excuses. It’s my time to assert my opinions onto the world.</p>

<p>Fuck fear. It’s time to be aware of inevitable failure and try anyway.</p>
